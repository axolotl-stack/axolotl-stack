# BDS extraction lane (T1 captures, T2 sweeps)

Measures BDS 1.26.51 on loopback so unastar can copy it (decisions D3/D4):
packet captures with `bds-extractor` (T1) and built-in facts with an Endstone
sweep harness (T2). Everything here needs a BDS runtime: the shared one
(`C:/Users/jvigu/orca/bds-runtime`, one session at a time) or a parallel slot
(see [Parallel slots](#parallel-slots)). Never launches the Minecraft client.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `bds_runtime.py` | Starts/stops the BDS of one runtime, `BDS_RUNTIME` on `BDS_PORT` (plain or under Endstone): refuses when a `bedrock_server` from that runtime's `server/` runs or the port is bound, backs up and restores `server.properties`, harness-owned world names only, graceful `stop` |
| `capture.py` | T1: two `bds-extractor --capture-dir` sessions on plain BDS (member join; operator join + `/summon` of every summonable identifier) into `<runtime>/captures/1.26.51/<UTC>/`; `--commands FILE` runs one operator session of scripted commands instead (`operator-commands/command-outputs.json`, plus `console-outputs.json`: BDS's console lines by step, typed for `!console` steps; `allowlist.json`, `permissions.json` and `keys/` are restored afterwards) |
| `command-script.txt` | The vanilla command feedback script for `capture.py --commands` (`# segment: NAME` groups lines that unastar's tests replay together; every segment leaves the world as it found it; `!console COMMAND` runs on the server console, `!join NAME` / `!leave NAME` bring a second player in and out) |
| `command_digest.py` | `command-outputs.json` to a readable per-command `digest.md` (CommandOutput fields, key fields of every other packet) |
| `commit_fixtures.py` | Copies the committed subset of a capture into `crates/bds-extractor/captures/1.26.51/` (see the crate README); `--commands CAPTURE` commits a command session's `feedback.json` |
| `scripts/command-order.txt` | A `bds-sweep-client --script` script: block commands sent right before (or one input before) the input that starts breaking the block, on plain BDS (flat world, survival, operator) |
| `command_order_fixture.py` | Cuts a capture of `scripts/command-order.txt` into `crates/unastar/src/server/game/testdata/bds-command-order.jsonl` (commands, inputs and crack starts of four scenarios) |
| `pvp_race.py` | Packet-order and PvP race captures: `script CASE` writes a script for `order_probe` (cases in `pvp_race_scripts.py`), `run SCRIPT [--join-order BAC] [--property KEY=VALUE]` plays it on plain BDS (new flat survival world, everyone operator) and keeps `events.jsonl` in `<runtime>/captures/1.26.51/pvp-race-<UTC>/` |
| `pvp_race_scripts.py` | The race matrix: held attacks (`queue`, `model`), mutual hits, victim input, sprint and sneak, crits, reach, bursts, lag, hurt window, kills, pairs of players at one health (`pairs`, `both-low`), teleports |
| `pvp_race_summary.py` | Groups an `events.jsonl` by trial: hurt, health, knockback, crits, corrections, actor flags, sounds, with input-tick stamps made relative; prints each variant's outcome distribution and the output-burst timing; marks trials that span a BDS stall |
| `pvp_race_fixture.py` | Cuts captures into `crates/unastar/src/server/game/testdata/pvp-race-*.jsonl` (header with outcome distributions, then one trial per variant) |
| `level_data.py` | Where BDS saves level data: `measure` gives every value of a new flat world a non-default setting from the console and an operator player (`bds-extractor --uuid`), stops, reloads and queries it (and a second player lists the scores while the first is offline); `clocks` checks which clock BDS loads; `import WORLD` opens a world unastar wrote and asks the same queries; `daylock` measures `/daylock`; `dump WORLD` prints `level.dat` and the level records; `fixture` writes `crates/unastar/tests/fixtures/bds_1_26_51_level_data.json`. Reads world copies with `leveldb_read.py`; snapshots stay in OUT |
| `command_probe.py` | Console and operator-player answers for commands `command-script.txt` does not cover (`reloadconfig`, `reloadpacketlimitconfig`, `wsserver`, `script`, `place`, `locate`, `ride`, `packstack`) on a new flat world; `fixture` writes `crates/unastar/src/command/exec/testdata/bds-command-probe.json` (local paths redacted) |
| `le_nbt.py` | Little-endian NBT reader and writer (types and compound order kept) for `level.dat` and level records, independent of unastar |
| `block_names.py` | `script OUT` writes a `/testforblock` script over every palette block; `table CAPTURE` turns its capture into `crates/unastar-data/data/measured/block_name_keys.json` |
| `sweep.py` | T2: one sweep job under Endstone with `bds-sweep-client` as the player; output in `<runtime>/sweeps/1.26.51/<kind>-<UTC>/` |
| `endstone-sweep/` | The Endstone Python plugin that runs jobs server-side (inert unless `BDS_SWEEP_JOB` is set) |
| `summarize.py` | Raw sweep results to `crates/unastar-data/data/measured/` + `manifest.json` |
| `native.py` | Readers for protocolgen's CC0 native data (block palette, mining classes, items, item tags) the jobs are built from |
| `test_bds_sweep.py` | Tests for the BDS-free parts: `python -m unittest discover -s tools/bds-sweep -p "test_*.py"` |

## Setup (once)

```powershell
$py = 'C:/Users/jvigu/orca/bds-runtime/venv/Scripts/python.exe'
& $py -m pip install --no-deps -e tools/bds-sweep/endstone-sweep
cargo build -p bds-extractor -p bds-sweep
```

## Parallel slots

The shared runtime runs one BDS at a time. To run several captures or sweeps at
once, use slot runtimes: copies of the server folder, each on its own port. The
launcher only refuses a `bedrock_server` started from its own `server/` folder,
so slots never block each other. A slot directory holds `server/` (a copy of the
shared server without its worlds, logs or crash reports), `world-template/`,
`captures/`, `sweeps/` and `venv`, a directory junction to the shared venv, so
the editable `endstone-bds-sweep` install is shared.

| Slot | `BDS_RUNTIME` | `BDS_PORT` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `C:/Users/jvigu/orca/bds-slots/slot1` | 19150 |
| 2 | `C:/Users/jvigu/orca/bds-slots/slot2` | 19160 |
| 3 | `C:/Users/jvigu/orca/bds-slots/slot3` | 19170 |
| 4 | `C:/Users/jvigu/orca/bds-slots/slot4` | 19180 |

Set both variables before running `capture.py` or `sweep.py`; the harness passes
`127.0.0.1:<BDS_PORT>` to `bds-extractor` and `bds-sweep-client`. The IPv6 port
is `BDS_PORT + 1`. Keep slot ports off 19132, where unastar listens. Agents
sharing the machine claim a slot with `mkdir <slot>/agent.lock` (atomic), write
who and what into `agent.lock/owner.txt`, and remove the directory when the run
ends.

To create a slot, copy `bds-runtime/server` without `worlds/`, `logs/` and
`crash_reports/`, copy `world-template/`, create empty `server/worlds/`,
`captures/` and `sweeps/`, and link the venv:
`mklink /J <slot>\venv C:\Users\jvigu\orca\bds-runtime\venv`. Slots hold the
same BDS 1.26.51 build; the launcher checks `version.txt` either way.

## Scripted client controls

The plugin sends these chat orders to `bds-sweep-client`:

| Order | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `bds-sweep:mine X Y Z FACE PREDICT` | Start/continue breaking; optional predicted break after `PREDICT` ticks |
| `bds-sweep:stop` | Abort the current mining action |
| `bds-sweep:attack RUNTIME_ID` | Attack using the synchronized held stack |
| `bds-sweep:drop hotbar SLOT COUNT` | Closed-screen Drop from hotbar index 0..8; count 1 is Q, a full stack is ctrl-Q |
| `bds-sweep:drop inventory SLOT COUNT` | Open the inventory, wait for its server-allocated window ID, then Drop from native inventory index 0..35 |
| `bds-sweep:close-inventory` | Close the tracked native inventory window |

`order_probe` (`crates/bds-sweep/src/bin/order_probe.rs`) is a second scripted client:
three players (`RaceA`, `RaceB`, `RaceC`) in one process, so a script line decides which
player sends what, in which order within a 50 ms tick, and which packets share a game
batch. It ticks from a thread clock (a tokio interval ticks every ~62 ms on Windows; see
`docs/solutions/tooling/time-scripted-clients-with-a-thread-clock-on-windows.md`). Script
actions and the output format are in its module docs.

Drop references come only from server `InventoryContent`/`InventorySlot`
updates; missing/empty/idless slots and invalid counts fail rather than invent
a stack net ID. Requests use negative odd IDs. `--capture-dir DIR` records
both directions, including unhandled actor packets, to `DIR/packets.jsonl`;
records are flushed individually and the recorder closes on normal/error exit.
Windows debug startup uses the same enlarged codec stack as `bds-extractor`.
The entity probe's `player-drop` mode drives the bounded two-client experiment;
see `crates/unastar/README.md` for its setup and retained native evidence.


## Jobs

| Kind | What one item measures | Arena / method |
|---|---|---|
| `drops` | `samples` x `/loot spawn … mine … mainhand` per (block state, tool) | block at (3,-60,0) set without physics; tools: hand, every tier of each correct digger, one wrong digger, shears, silk touch and fortune I-III on the diamond correct tool |
| `mining` | break ticks per (block state, tool, effect/environment), 3 trials | player (survival) at (0.5,-60,0.5) facing the west face of (1,-59,0); client sends Start/ContinueDestroyBlock, BDS breaks the block itself; ticks from the LEFT_CLICK_BLOCK event to the BlockBreakEvent (±1 tick) |
| `armor-slots` | `/replaceitem` accept per slot (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand) | read back with Endstone `PlayerInventory` |
| `armor-values` | health lost per `/damage <player> D entity_attack` wearing one item | max health 2000, hits repeated for sub-point precision; needs the full `armor-slots` result for slot assignment |
| `attack` | melee damage per held item, warm-up + 3 trials | a fresh pig at (2,-60,0.5); the client sends an InventoryTransaction attack; Endstone `ActorDamageEvent` value |
| `fuel` | furnace burn ticks per item | pool of 32 furnaces, 1 cobblestone input + the item as fuel |

```powershell
& $py tools/bds-sweep/sweep.py drops --blocks all --samples 400   # first palette state of every block
& $py tools/bds-sweep/sweep.py drops --blocks minecraft:wheat --states all
& $py tools/bds-sweep/sweep.py mining --blocks slice
& $py tools/bds-sweep/sweep.py armor-slots --items all
& $py tools/bds-sweep/sweep.py fuel --items all
& $py tools/bds-sweep/summarize.py drops <dir> [<repeat dir> ...]
```

Sweeps are resumable: rerun with the same `--out` and finished items
(`results.jsonl`) are skipped. To hand the BDS over mid-run, create
`<out>/stop.request`; the runner stops BDS gracefully and restores
`server.properties`. To pause a queue of runs at the next job boundary,
create `<runtime>/sweeps/1.26.51/hold`: every new `sweep.py` exits without
starting BDS while it exists.

A few block states crash Endstone in `Block.set_data`. The plugin marks the
item in flight (`<out>/inflight.json`, removed on a graceful stop); when a
run dies on it, the resumed run records that state as `crashed` for every
tool and moves on, so rerunning `sweep.py` with the same `--out` until
`done.json` appears completes the sweep.

## Runtimes observed (2026-10-25, turbo boost off; compare only like with like)

| `armor-slots --items all` | 2,075 | 13 s |
| `armor-values` (31 items, 31 hits each) | 31 | 12 min |
| `attack` (43 tools, warm-up + 3 trials) | 43 | 2 min |
| `fuel --items all` (lava bucket burns 20,000 ticks) | 2,075 | 19 min |
| `mining --blocks slice` (10 blocks, 3 trials per variant) | 176 | ~20 min in two parts |
| `drops --blocks all --states all --samples 64` | 287,231 cells | ~50 min over 7 attempts (5 crashing states skipped, 3 handovers) |
