# Unastar

**Unastar** is the planned high-performance Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server implementation built on top of the Axolotl Stack.

> **Status:** Active implementation; compatibility gates still in progress.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

Unastar aims to be more than just "another server software." It is designed to be the reference implementation for `Jolyne` and `Valentine`.

### ðŸš€ High Performance
- **ECS Architecture**: Leverage Entity Component System (ECS) patterns (likely via `bevy` or `hecs`) for cache-efficient entity ticking.
- **Parallel Execution**: Offload heavy tasks (chunk generation, compression, encryption) to worker threads while keeping the main logic loop fast and predictable.

### ðŸ§© Modularity
- **Plugin System**: Design a robust plugin API (possibly Wasm-based or dynamic loading) to allow community extensions without recompiling the server.
- **Behavior Packs**: Native support for vanilla Behavior Packs for entity and block definitions.

### ðŸ›¡ï¸ Reliability
- **Crash Resilience**: Isolate subsystems so a scripting error doesn't take down the whole server.
- **Strict Compliance**: Follow the pinned Bedrock protocol version and publish compatibility only after the roadmap smoke gates pass. Broad all-client-version compatibility is a goal, not current evidence.

## ðŸ”® Roadmap

1.  **Core Loop**: Implement a stable 50ms tick loop with `Jolyne` networking integration.
2.  **World Management**: Chunk storage, loading, and serialization (LevelDB/Anvil).
3.  **Entity System**: Basic entity spawning, movement, and tracking.
4.  **Interaction**: Block breaking/placing and inventory management.


## Compatibility Evidence

Unastar's tactical compatibility gates live in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Current development should prioritize:

1. Jolyne login/resource-pack/start-game smoke coverage.
2. A one-client Unastar boot/join/chunk smoke test.
3. Server-authoritative inventory, movement, and block interaction validation.
4. Data provenance checks for blocks, items, biomes, entities, creative content, and worldgen.

Until those gates pass, describe Unastar as a Bedrock server implementation in progress rather than a fully vanilla-compatible server.
